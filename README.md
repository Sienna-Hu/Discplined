I plan to make an application that allows users to record and review their workout routines. 

The application will have a checklist page, where the users can add trainings they usually do and check them when they do the workout. Meanwhile, the application will keep a record of users' workout experience. It looks like the monthly workkouts highlights in Health (see below), but for every type of training.
